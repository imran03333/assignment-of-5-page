        <p>lahore</p><br> Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan, and the capital of Punjab province. It is a city rich with the imprints of time, is today a sprawling metropolis of the Punjab. Set like a verdant jewel in the heart of the province, it pulsates with life. It holds within it bustling bazaars, multifaceted crowds and bewitching colors. If one were to go by legends, Lahore was founded by Loh the son of Rama Chandra. However the recorded history of Lahore dates back to 850 A.D conquered by Mahmoud Ghazni in 1021 A.D. It was made the capital of the Ghaznavid east of the Indus and later capital of the entire Ghaznavid Empire by Masud, the son of Mahmood. It was then, that Lahore became the center of social, cultural and educational activities and continued to grow in stature, reaching the pinnacle of its glory under the Mughals who gave it its famous architecture, including the magnificent fort, gardens, tombs, mosques and pavilions. Lahore owes much to the Mughal princes, for it was here that Shah Jehan built the Shalimar Garden, Aurangzeb constructed the world famous Badshahi Mosque, and it is here that the emperor Jahangir and his beloved wife Nur Jehan are buried. The massively fortified walls of the Lahore fort speak eloquently of the days gone by. Its origin is not known; however Mughal emperor Akbar gave it a face-lift and made it one of the most splendid forts in the sub-continent. One can almost envision the royal princes and princesses moving within the calm splendor of its magnificent walls, the famous Antalkali Bazaar is almost adjacent to the historical Lahore museum, whose collection of coins and crafts unveils the secrets of centuries. The British during their reign (1849-1947) combined Mughal, Gothic and colonial architecture with Victorian style and constructed may historical buildings like the high court, government college, Lahore museum, national college of arts, Montgomery hall, Tolinton Market, Punjab university and Provincial Assembly Hall. Lahore offers a great deal more than just monuments. A variety of art galleries, museums, theaters and shopping arcades, lush green lawns, the parks, the fountains and modern high-rise buildings, add to the character and charm of a city.<br>
